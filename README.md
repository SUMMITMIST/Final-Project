Stepan Kiselev's Final project. "Charon's Labyrinth"

Hi there!
My name is Stepan, and here is my final work for my diploma. I got 10/10 for this so it must be not as bad as you think.
There is one level of labyrinth where you have to find all the coins, find the key and escape the labyrinth.

In case you want to test my project and just download the playable version: https://disk.yandex.ru/d/eJ0ngKQfqGZkqg

There are both project folder and compilied game.
Feel free to  test it as many times as you want hehe
